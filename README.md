# AMD research code

This repository contains the code used in the following study: "Evaluating an automated machine learning model that predicts visual outcomes in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration". We kindly also refer the reader to the Video attached in the appendix of this study, which demonstrates how we were able to run the What-if Tool on an AutoML model.

Notes:

The code was run using jupyter notebooks. In some cases (flagged in the files) we have separated a larger chunk of code into different files. This was done for ease of interpretation of the different functions the code carries out.
